The application aim is to enable the visualisation of atomic structures and their bonds, saved in the XYZ file. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first one of them is strictly theoretical, concerning physical chemistry, and the next three present the application issues and applied solutions. The application is a web application that has been created for mobile devices and personal computers. The thesis was made mainly on the basis of JavaScript libraries (ThreeJS and its auxiliary libraries).
Thesis concerns matters of among others loading and saving files, atoms visualizing, including adding, removing and modifying bonds between them, manipulating the frame and creating screenshots with the final appearance of the structure.
